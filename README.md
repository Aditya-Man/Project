# Project
project for computer graphics
A 3D Solar System simulation built using Blender’s Python API (bpy).
This project programmatically generates celestial bodies, orbital systems, materials, lighting, and cinematic camera animation — all from a single script and some blender applications.

Designed for educational visualization, animation rendering, and computational graphics demonstrations.
